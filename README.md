# Mall Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the **K-Means Clustering algorithm**. The segmentation is based on customer attributes like **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score** to identify distinct customer groups. The results provide valuable insights for businesses to personalize marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

---

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a key task for businesses to understand their customers better. This project applies machine learning to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their shopping behavior.

Key objectives:
1. Analyze customer data to understand spending habits and income distribution.
2. Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm for segmentation.
3. Visualize and interpret the clusters to derive actionable insights.

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer information with the following features:
- **Customer_id** : unique id of customers.
- **Gender** : gender of the customers.
- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Annual Income**: The yearly income of the customer (in $).
- **Spending Score**: A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending patterns.



## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Handle any missing or inconsistent data.
   - Normalize features for better clustering performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize relationships between Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
   - Identify patterns and trends.

3. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Train the K-Means model on the data.
   - Assign cluster labels to each customer.


## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of unsupervised learning for customer segmentation. Businesses can use such insights to optimize marketing campaigns and improve customer satisfaction.
